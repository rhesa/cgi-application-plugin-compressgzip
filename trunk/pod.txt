NAME
    CGI::Application::Plugin::CompressGzip - Add Gzip compression to
    CGI::Application

WARNING
    This is the initial release. I've not added any support for options or
    configuration, because CGI::Compress::Gzip works for me out of the box.

SYNOPSIS
        use CGI::Application::Plugin::CompressGzip;

        my $query = $self->query;
  
DESCRIPTION
    This plugin automatically enables gzip compression in your
    CGI::Application program. You "use" it once in your base class, and the
    rest is transparent.

    It does its work by overriding cgiapp_get_query, which returns a new
    CGI::Compress::Gzip object instead of the default CGI object.

  EXPORT
    cgiapp_get_query
