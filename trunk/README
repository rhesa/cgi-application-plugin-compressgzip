CGI-Application-Plugin-CompressGzip version 0.01
================================================

NAME
    CGI::Application::Plugin::CompressGzip - Add gzip compression to CGI::Application

WARNING
    This is the initial release. I've not added any support for options or configuration,
    because CGI::Compress::Gzip works for me out of the box.

SYNOPSIS
    use CGI::Application::Plugin::CompressGzip;

    my $query = $self->query;

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin automatically enables gzip compression in your CGI::Application program.
    You "use" it once in your base class, and the rest is transparent.

    It does its work by overriding cgiapp_get_query, which returns a new
    CGI::Compress::Gzip object instead of the default CGI object.
